Issues:

	- Initial learning curve. How to load a text file into a page?
	- Had trouble with printing function
		- was looking for a function to send texts to browser's built-in printer dialog
		- built in PrintDocument function in C# is too complicated and trying to actually do the printing job
		- searched for javascript functions, very easy to print whole page, but a lot more trouble to print just a section
		- found Jquery.print plugin 
	- Struggled a little to run jQuery functions on button click
